	    <h4>Single User Mode verses Provider Mode</h4>
	    <p>By default BioZen operates in Single User Mode. Meaning that only one person will be using the device to record meditation sessions. If more than one user will be using the device, Provider Mode may be enabled via the Preferences Selections. Provider mode will allow you to set up user accounts on the device via the BioZen user interface. Once logged in as a specific user you are allowed access only to your own sessions.</p>
	    <p><b>Provider Mode</b> changes the user interface at application startup. If “Provider Mode” is enabled, when the application is first started, you will be presented with a user selection screen which allows you to either select an existing user, or to add a new user. Once a user is selected the application will continue on as normal (with the exception of being able to create and see sessions for the selected user only).</p>
